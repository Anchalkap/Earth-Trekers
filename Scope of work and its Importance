Recommender systems have grown as an area of both research and practice. A personal tourist attractions recommender system is considered an effective way for tourists to tourist attractions search. The recommender system compares the collected data to similar and dissimilar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended attractions for the tourist. Collaborative filtering is considered to be memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering. By using this recommendation system tourists can easily search their favorite destination and tourist requirements are fulfilled.
