Now a days, many people rely on online services to plan a trip. However, they are usually faced with the problem of being supplied with lots of information. In consequence, they have to invest a great deal of time to decide what to visit, when, etc. This huge amount of possibilities available on the net makes it difficult for user to discern the more interesting offers from the rest.
In order to improve the tourist experience, recommender systems offer personalized information to users. In other words, the system selects the more suitable and adequate offers for users and offers activities appropriate to their profile.

In the past few years, with the proliferation of mobile devices people are experiencing frequent communication and information exchange. For instance, in the context of tourist visits, it is often the case that each person carries out a smartphone, to get information about touristic places. When one visits some location, a tourist guide application will recommend useful information, according to its current location, preferences, and past visits. Afterwards, the tourist guide allows for the user to provide feedback about each visit.
